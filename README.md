#  Nuclear Donut Data Center

A biomimetic, nuclear-integrated data center design using radial steam distribution, evaporative cooling, and ultra-low-cost land reuse within nuclear exclusion zones.

##  Overview

This project visualizes a next-generation data center optimized for:

- Direct nuclear energy integration
- Biomimetic cooling based on leaf airflow
- Radial architecture (donut-shaped) for maximum efficiency
- Modular rack expansion with 3Ã—3 tier design
- Evaporative cooling towers powered by waste steam

##  Key Features

- **Power**: Direct from 10-20MW nuclear reactor
- **Cooling**: Steam + evaporative
-
-   = 90% energy savings
- **Architecture**: Donut-style radial layout
- **Location**: Within existing nuclear exclusion zones (zero land cost)
- **Security**: Already nuclear-hardened

## Technologies Used

- HTML + CSS for the visual model
- Biomimicry principles (leaf, ant colony, spiral forms)
- Steam thermodynamics + passive cooling design
- JS or simulation to be added (future)

##  Economic Advantages

- 50â€“60% operational cost reduction
- Up to $155M in savings over 20 years
- Rapid ROI (6â€“14 months in some models)

##  Coming Soon

- Animated steam simulation
- Modular expansion visualizer
- Open-source dataset + blueprint system
